# Project Documentation

## 🎯 Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts **flight delays** — either as:
- **Regression**: predicting delay duration (in minutes), or  
- **Classification**: predicting whether a flight will be delayed (Yes/No).

## 🚀 Workflow
1. **Data Ingestion:** Collect historical flight, weather, and operational data.  
2. **Feature Engineering:** Create variables like departure hour, day-of-week, temperature, etc.  
3. **Model Training:** Train ML model (e.g., XGBoost, RandomForest, or LSTM).  
4. **Model Deployment:** Deploy using Docker and serve API via Flask/FastAPI.  
5. **MLOps Tracking:** Use MLflow, Prometheus, and Whylogs for model monitoring.  

## 🧠 Impact
Accurately predicting delays helps:
- Airlines reschedule proactively  
- Airports improve gate and crew management  
- Passengers receive timely updates and smoother travel experiences
